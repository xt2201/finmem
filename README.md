Update (Date: 06-16-2024)

Thank you to all the participants and organizers of the IJCAI2024 challenge, "Financial Challenges in Large Language Models - FinLLM". Our team, FinMem, was thrilled to contribute to Task 3: Single Stock Trading.

As the challenge wrapped up yesterday (06/15/2024), we reflect on the innovative approaches and insights gained throughout this journey. A total of 12 teams participated, each bringing unique perspectives and solutions to the forefront of financial AI and Large Language Models.

We invite the community to continue engaging with us as we look forward to further developments and collaborations in this exciting field.


Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited notable efficacy in question-answering (QA) tasks across diverse domains. Their prowess in integrating extensive web knowledge has fueled interest in developing LLM-based autonomous agents. While LLMs are efficient in decoding human instructions and deriving solutions by holistically processing historical inputs, transitioning to purpose-driven agents requires a supplementary rational architecture to process multi-source information, establish reasoning chains, and prioritize critical tasks. Addressing this, we introduce FinMem, a novel LLM-based agent framework devised for financial decision-making, encompassing three core modules: Profiling, to outline the agent's characteristics; Memory, with layered processing, to aid the agent in assimilating realistic hierarchical financial data; and Decision-making, to convert insights gained from memories into investment decisions. Notably, FinMem's memory module aligns closely with the cognitive structure of human traders, offering robust interpretability and real-time tuning. Its adjustable cognitive span allows for the retention of critical information beyond human perceptual limits, thereby enhancing trading outcomes. This framework enables the agent to self-evolve its professional knowledge, react agilely to new investment cues, and continuously refine trading decisions in the volatile financial environment. We first compare FinMem with various algorithmic agents on a scalable real-world financial dataset, underscoring its leading trading performance in stocks and funds. We then fine-tuned the agent's perceptual spans to achieve a significant trading performance. Collectively, FinMem presents a cutting-edge LLM agent framework for automated trading, boosting cumulative investment returns.

## Usage

### Setting Environment Variables

The project uses Cerebras for LLM generation and HuggingFace for embeddings (defaulting to `intfloat/multilingual-e5-large`).

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```bash
CEREBRAS_API_KEY = "<Your Cerebras API Key>"
HF_TOKEN = "<Your HF token>"
```

### Setup with uv

The recommended way to set up the environment is using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv).

1. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
uv venv .venv --python 3.10
source .venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
uv pip install -r pyproject.toml
```

### Running Tests

A comprehensive test suite is available in the `tests/` directory.

To run all tests and see a summary:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python tests/run_all_tests.py
```

This will execute tests for:
- HuggingFace Embedding integration
- Cerebras LLM Chat functionality
- Memory scoring and decay functions
- MemoryDB and BrainDB operations
- Portfolio tracking and feedback
- Market Environment simulation loop

Test results are stored JSON format in `tests/outputs/`.

## Program

The program has two main functionalities:

```bash
 Usage: run.py sim [OPTIONS]

 Start Simulation

 Options
 --market-data-path    -mdp      TEXT  The environment data pickle path [default: data/06_input/subset_symbols.pkl]
 --start-time          -st       TEXT  The training or test start time [default: 2022-06-30 For Ticker 'TSLA']
 --end-time            -et       TEXT  The training or test end time [default: 2022-10-11]
 --run-model           -rm       TEXT  Run mode: train or test [default: train]
 --config-path         -cp       TEXT  config file path [default: config/config.toml]
 --checkpoint-path     -ckp      TEXT  The checkpoint save path [default: data/10_checkpoint_test]
 --result-path         -rp       TEXT  The result save path [default: data/11_train_result]
 --trained-agent-path  -tap      TEXT  Only used in test mode, the path of trained agent [default: None. Can be changed to data/05_train_model_output OR data/06_train_checkpoint]
 --help                                Show this message and exit.
```
                              
```

Notice our model has two modes: `train` and `test`. In the train mode, the information populate the agent's memory. In the test mode, the agent will use the information in the memory and new information to make decisions. When `test` mode is selected, the trained agent must be provided.

When the program stopped due to exceptions (API instability, etc.), the training/testing process can be resumed with

```bash
                                                                                                                                            
 Usage: run.py sim-checkpoint [OPTIONS]

 Start Simulation from checkpoint

 Options
 --checkpoint-path  -cp      TEXT  The checkpoint path [default: data/06_train_checkpoint]
 --result-path      -rp      TEXT  The result save path [default: data/05_train_model_output]
 --config-path      -ckp      TEXT  config file path [default: config/tsla_config.toml]
 --run-model        -rm      TEXT  Run mode: train or test [default: train]
 --help                            Show this message and exit.
```
